# 2048-Game
The 2048 game is a puzzle where players combine tiles with powers of 2 by sliding them in four directions to reach a tile with the number 2048. It ends when no valid moves are left. Built with Python and Tkinter, the game features AI autoplay using the minimax algorithm and keeps track of the player's score.
